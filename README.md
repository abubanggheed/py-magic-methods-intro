# Python Magic Methods Intro

This repository is to introduce myself and others to Python's magic methods. demo.py is a file that contains custom classes that implement python's magic methods to add mathematical operations on objects of those classes.

### Tabs or Spaces?
The python in this repository was written with spaces, not tabs. If you intend to clone down this repository, use spaces or risk bugs.

Note: I automatically configured tabs to be written as 4 spaces. The way to do this is different on every code editor.

### Set-Up
To run the demo, use the following terminal command:
```
python*version* -i demo.py
```
if that doesn't work, try:
```
py -i demo.py
```
If you don't know your version of python check it with
```
python --version
```
Typically macs come with python installed by default. The -i is to keep python running after finishing compiling the code. This allows you to use the terminal to play with all the magic methods implemented in the custom classes.

To exit, use `quit()`, or `control + z`.
If `control + z` doesn't work, try `control + c`.
